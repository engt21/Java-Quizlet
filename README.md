# Java-Quizlet

Author: Timothy Eng
Created: May 2016

Description: This Java program is a text file reader and comparison checker. I originally wrote it to help my studying for French class, including vocabulary and grammar. It is essentially a barebones Java implementation of the website Quizlet, minus their special features. It uses I/O and conditionals/loops to allow the user to input answers that will compared with the "question" bank. Each answer is associated with a corresponding question.
